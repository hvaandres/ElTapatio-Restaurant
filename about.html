                El Tapatio is a Mexican Restaurant that allows us to share with you the culture and the sense of family
                that we have for others. At this point, you will wonder why we are telling you this but, what we try to
                do is to give you an idea of what is being part of a Mexican family.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our restaurant will have a sense of traditional food from Guadalajara, Mexico. If you don't know where
                is this place, you will need to pay attention to the following information:

            </p>

            <p>
                Guadalajara is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Jalisco, and the seat of the
                municipality of Guadalajara. The city is in the central region of Jalisco in the Western-Pacific area of
                Mexico.
            </p>

            <p>
                This place is where you will find the most beautiful places like the state of Tequila, Hospicio Cabanas,
                Guadalajara Cathedral, Rotonda de los Jalicienses Ilustres, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                This city is the 10th largest Latin America city in population, urban area, and gross domestic product.
                Also, Guadalajara is a cultural center of Mexico, considered by the most to be the home of mariachi
                music and host to a number of large-scale cultural events as the Guadalajara International Film
                Festival, the Guadalajara International Book Fair, and globally renowned cultural events which draw
                international crowds.
            </p>

            <p>

                With all this information, we already think that we give you an idea of what the city looks. Also, we
                give you a sense of what is being in Guadalajara. <br> <br> For the same reason, we would like to invite
                you
                to
                enjoy our food as much as we would like to let you know that you can feel at home every single time that
                you visit us since we would like you to be part of our family.
            </p>

            <p>
                El Tapatio is more than a restaurant for us since we build this place with the idea of achieving our
                American Dream. This place is part of a Mexican tradition and for the same reason, we would like to try
                to give you the best experience.

            </p>

            <p>
                With all this being said, we would like to welcome you to come to our restaurant to try all our
                traditional plates. Please let us know if you have any idea of how we can improve and please let us know
                if you have questions or concerns at admin@eltapatio.com.
            </p>

                    <p>This traditional plate is unique because you will never see something like this in any other
                        restaurant. This plate is created with the intention of giving you a sense of Mexican and
                        Tropical food. The idea of this plate is to tell you how good this plate it is. In other words,
                        this plate has an innovate idea of giving you a taste of the all Mexican seasoning.</p>

                        This is a plate that has two different cultures and if you don't know what we are talking about,
                        you will need to start thinking in two different cultures like American and Mexican traditions.
                        This plate is more like fast food combined with the Mexican seasoning taste.</p>
